# scripts

Just a repo of simple scripts that I used at some point

- [`create-lodash-structure`](https://github.com/nikitarevenco/scripts/blob/main/create-lodash-structure.sh): Generated all of the lodash library's utility functions in a file tree as utility-function.ts with utility-function.test.ts containing empty vitest tests under /utility-function-group/utility-function/
- [`create-scoop-info-table`](https://github.com/nikitarevenco/scripts/blob/main/create-scoop-info-table.js): Dynamically created a table containing links to homepage and description for each scoop package that I use for my windows dotfiles repo
